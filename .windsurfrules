when you want specific information about Three.js, use this MCP to query for relevant documentation, Ex: 
debug/direct-threejs-query.js "how to create a shiny material"

When you need specific information available from the web you don't have comprehensive training on not directly related to Three.js,
or the user mentions perplexity, 
use the query format 'node debug/direct-perplexity-query.js "Your question for perplexity here"'
