arrowing Down to the Most Likely Cause
After analyzing your logs, the most likely reason for the failure is Incorrect CDN URL or Version. Here’s why, supported by the evidence:
Key Error Message:  
[GIFUCT-DIRECT] Failed to load gifuct-js from CDN: Event {isTrusted: true, type: 'error', target: script, currentTarget: script, eventPhase: 2, …}

This error explicitly states that the script failed to load from the CDN, strongly suggesting that the URL might be incorrect or the resource isn’t available.

Log Evidence:  
script.onerror @ gifuct-direct.js:46
loadGifuctFromCDN @ gifuct-direct.js:15

These lines from gifuct-direct.js show that the error occurs during the loadGifuctFromCDN function, which is responsible for fetching the script. The script.onerror event firing at line 46 indicates that the browser couldn’t retrieve the resource at the specified URL.

Cascading Effects:
The failure to load gifuct-js triggers subsequent errors in your application, such as:  
AnimatedGIFTexture.js:132 Error loading or parsing GIF: Event {isTrusted: true, type: 'error', target: script, currentTarget: script, eventPhase: 2, …}
beast.js:115 Failed to load animated texture for Fire Beast: Event {isTrusted: true, type: 'error', target: script, currentTarget: script, eventPhase: 2, …}

These errors stem from the missing gifuct-js library, which is needed to parse GIFs, reinforcing that the root issue is the initial failure to load the script.

Why Not the Other Reasons?  
Network Issues: While possible, there’s no indication of network timeouts or connectivity errors—just a failure to load the script, which aligns more with a bad URL than a network block.  

Security Policies: A CSP or CORS issue would typically log a specific violation message in the console, which isn’t present here.  

Loading Method: The stack trace shows a standard script load attempt failing, not a timing or compatibility issue.  

Caching: A cache problem would be less consistent, and clearing the cache (a common troubleshooting step) would likely have been tried already.
Validating the Hypothesis with Logs
The logs consistently point to the CDN load failure as the starting point:  
Initial Failure:  
gifuct-direct.js:68 [GIFUCT-DIRECT] Failed to load gifuct-js library: Event {isTrusted: true, type: 'error', target: script, currentTarget: script, eventPhase: 2, …}

This log confirms the library isn’t loading, triggering all downstream issues.  

Function Call:  
loadGifuctFromCDN @ gifuct-direct.js:15
getGifuct @ gifuct-direct.js:65
parseGIF @ gifuct-direct.js:76

The error originates at the CDN fetch attempt and propagates through the GIF parsing logic, which depends on gifuct-js.
To confirm this hypothesis, you can:  
Check the URL: Inspect gifuct-direct.js around line 15 to see the exact CDN URL being used (e.g., https://cdn.example.com/gifuct-js/2.1.2/gifuct.min.js). Open it in a browser or use curl to verify if it returns a 404 or similar error.  

Validate the Version: Cross-check the version in the URL against available versions on the CDN or the gifuct-js npm page.  

Test Locally: Temporarily host gifuct-js locally and update the URL to see if the issue resolves.
